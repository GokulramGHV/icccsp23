        Processing 2023 (ICCCSP &apos;23) has been planned to highlight the
        rapidly developing technologies related to Artificial Intelligence (AI),
        Knowledge Engineering and IoT for Smart Systems. The conference will
        provide a premier interdisciplinary platform for researchers,
        practitioners, and educators to present and discuss the most recent
        innovations, trends, and concerns encountered and solutions adopted in
        the fields of AI , Knowledge engineering and IoT for smart systems. The
